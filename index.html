    <p> I am an interactive design student at SAIT taking the graphic design stream. 
      I was born in Calgary, but grew up living out of the city in a small town for my childhood.
      I love animals, food, movies, fashion, dancing, sports. I grew up doing both sports and art and found joy in each.
      However, being creative has always been my strong suit and I find peace and purpose from being creative.
      Where my body had it's limitations my mind could keep pushing and expanding, being creative had no limits for me!
